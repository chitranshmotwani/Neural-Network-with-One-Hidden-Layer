# Neural-Network-with-One-Hidden-Layer
This GitHub repository contains an implementation of a neural network with a single hidden layer. The neural network architecture consists of an input layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the fundamental principles of neural networks, specifically focusing on a network with one hidden layer.

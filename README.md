# Neural-Network-with-One-Hidden-Layer
This repository contains an implementation of a neural network with a single hidden layer. The neural network architecture consists of an input layer, one hidden layer, and an output layer. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the fundamental principles of neural networks, specifically focusing on a network with one hidden layer.

## Key Features

- Implementation of a neural network with one hidden layer.
- Utilization of popular programming frameworks or libraries for neural network development.
- Demonstration of forward and backward propagation algorithms.
- Training and evaluation of the neural network on a specific dataset, showcasing its learning capabilities.
- Visualization of training progress and model performance through appropriate metrics and plots.
